Hello!
My name is Rain and Iâ€™m currently an MSBA candidate at Goizueta Business School after graduating this May with a BBA and a BSc in data science in the college.
I was born in Beijing but raised in Auckland, New Zealand, where I discovered my interest in fashion.
Post graduation, I hope to explore the data analytics space in wearble technology before ultimately transitioning to entrepreneurial work back home.
